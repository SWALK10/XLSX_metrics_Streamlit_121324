# Dynamic Risk-Free Rate Implementation Change Log

## Overview
Implementation of dynamic Treasury rates (^IRX) to replace static 3% risk-free rate

## Backup Reference
- Full backup created: `XLSX_metrics_Streamlit_Backup_121424`
- Contains working version with static 3% rate
- All features functional including footnotes section

## Planned Changes

### Phase 1: Data Structure
1. Create new directory:
   ```
   data/
     └── treasury_rates/
         └── daily_rates.csv
   ```
2. CSV Structure:
   ```csv
   date,rate
   2024-12-15,0.0422
   ```

### Phase 2: Protected Files Requiring Permission
1. `src/models/performance_metrics.py`:
   - Current state: Uses static `RISK_FREE_RATE = 0.03`
   - Planned change: Replace with dynamic rate from CSV
   - Lines affected: Need to review
   - Reversion: Restore `RISK_FREE_RATE = 0.03` constant

### Phase 3: Test Implementation Steps
1. Create test script to verify ^IRX data fetching
2. Test CSV read/write without timestamps
3. Verify rate updates only during market hours
4. Compare Sharpe calculations: static vs dynamic

## Rules Compliance
- No timestamps or timezones
- No changes to protected code without permission
- Maintain existing functionality
- Keep backup for reversion

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] ^IRX data availability
- [ ] CSV format verification
- [ ] Rate update logic
- [ ] Sharpe calculation accuracy
- [ ] Performance impact

## Reversion Plan
1. Delete new treasury_rates directory
2. Restore performance_metrics.py from backup
3. Remove any new imports or dependencies
