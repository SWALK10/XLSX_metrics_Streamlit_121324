## Cross-References

### For Developers
1. Start with: README.md
2. Then review: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
3. Follow with: DATA_FLOW.md
4. Finally: CALCULATIONS.md and TESTING.md

### For Maintenance
1. Start with: WORKING_STATE.md
2. Then review: DATA_FLOW.md
3. Follow with: TESTING.md
4. Finally: CALCULATIONS.md

### For Updates
1. Start with: WORKING_STATE.md
2. Then review: CALCULATIONS.md
3. Follow with: TESTING.md
4. Update: DATA_FLOW.md as needed

## Documentation Update Process

### When Adding Features
1. Update CALCULATIONS.md with new formulas
2. Add tests to TESTING.md
3. Update DATA_FLOW.md with new processes
4. Update WORKING_STATE.md after validation

### When Fixing Bugs
1. Document fix in WORKING_STATE.md
2. Update TESTING.md with new test cases
3. Review/update CALCULATIONS.md if needed
4. Update DATA_FLOW.md if process changed

### When Refactoring
1. Update PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
2. Review/update DATA_FLOW.md
3. Update TESTING.md procedures
4. Verify WORKING_STATE.md still accurate

## Documentation Standards

### Format
- Use Markdown for all docs
- Include table of contents for long docs
- Use code blocks for examples
- Include section numbers
- Cross-reference other docs using relative links

### Content
- Keep each doc focused on its purpose
- Avoid duplicating information
- Use examples for clarity
- Include error cases and solutions
- Update timestamps when modified

### Maintenance
- Review all docs when making changes
- Keep WORKING_STATE.md current
