# Test Environment for Sharpe Ratio Calculations

This directory contains test versions of files for experimenting with Sharpe ratio calculations.
All files are prefixed with 'S_' to distinguish them from the original implementation.

## Purpose
- Test alternative Sharpe ratio calculations
- Compare results with current implementation
- Focused on dividend-adjusted data processing
- Uses BIL for risk-free rate (consistent with main implementation)

## Files
- S_excel_manager.py: Test version of data management
- S_dashboard_xlsx_viewer_v4_test2.py: Test version of dashboard
